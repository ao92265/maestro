 * the graph at render time ({@link prWorkflowStepsInOrder}), so a step the
 * user adds in the workflow editor shows up as one more checkbox with no
 * code change here.
 *
 * The walk rule (start node, first outgoing edge, stop on revisit) comes from
 * `@/lib/workflowGraph` rather than being restated here, so it stays identical
 * to what the canvas draws — and importing it costs the PR panel nothing,
 * since that module carries no React Flow dependency.
