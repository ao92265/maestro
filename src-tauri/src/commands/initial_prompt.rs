//! Generic "launch a terminal with an initial prompt" delivery.
//!
//! Any caller can open a terminal through the pending-launch flow and have a
//! prompt of its own typed into the session once claude is actually up. The
//! frontend arms the just-launched session via
//! [`terminal_arm_initial_prompt`] right before the CLI command is typed, and
//! the session's FIRST `SessionStarted` hook signal — claude at its prompt —
//! triggers [`InitialPromptInjector::on_session_started`] (tapped from
//! lib.rs's `hook_emit_fn`, the same gate the replicator uses for successor
//! briefs and the harvest triage uses for its journal prompt).
//!
//! This is [`super::harvest`]'s delivery gate with the journal removed: same
//! arm-then-inject-on-`SessionStarted` shape, the same
//! `core::samurai_pty::submit_instruction_confirmed` delivery (body write
//! confirmed on the calling thread, then the scaled gap and the lone Enter —
//! issue #103), and the same disarm-BEFORE-deliver ordering so a later
//! `SessionStarted` in the same terminal (e.g. `/clear`) can never
//! double-inject. Harvest keeps its own state machine because its prompt is
//! built AT injection time from the live journal and its consumption commit
//! is contingent on the write landing — neither of which a caller-supplied
//! fixed prompt has to model. Both share [`super::harvest::DeliverFn`], so
//! there is exactly one production delivery shape.
//!
//! **PTY safety is enforced here, not at the call site.** A newline inside an
//! injected prompt submits a partial message (the `core::samurai_prompts`
//! rule), so [`normalize_prompt`] collapses every whitespace run — newlines
//! included — to a single space before the text is ever handed to the PTY. A
//! caller cannot get this wrong from TypeScript.
//!
//! Flattening keeps the PTY safe but destroys a long prompt's structure, and
//! a multi-KB payload is not reliably delivered even flattened (issue #137).
//! So a caller may also name a brief target ([`BriefTarget`]): an over-budget
//! prompt is then written UNFLATTENED through `core::samurai_brief` and what
//! is typed is the one-line pointer at that file. Normalization still runs on
//! whatever is actually typed, so the invariant above is unchanged.
